# Assembly code

Here there are some game functions that plays *SAD* files. I have commented
and clean the code to make them more readable. Now, it's easy to
understand the file format.

The code has been extracted from *Ni no kuni: Shikkoku no Mad≈çshi*
Nintendo DS game.

1. **playAudio**: Receive a structure with the path to the file to play.
